# What is Flashback?

Flashback is (will be) a [Spaced Repetition Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software) with a mobile-first, offline-first design.  It takes many concepts from existing programs such as [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/).

You can read my blog post about how I believe [Anki falls short](http://verbally.flimzy.com/pet-peeves-about-anki/) as an explanation for some of the improvements I eventually hope will exist in Flashback.

Flashback is currently in the very early stages of development, and as such there's not really much to see here.

# License

The Flashback client is open source, and released under the MIT license (see LICENSE.txt for details).

The server software is not open source, but the intention is to make access to it free, with the possibility to pay for premium features (such as professionally-created flash card decks) at some future date.
